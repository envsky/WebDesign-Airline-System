        <strong>Terms and Conditions</strong>

        <p><strong>Flight</strong></p>
        <ul style="list-style-type:disc; margin-left: 30px;">
            <li>I agree to the fare rules, Terms & Conditions, Privacy Policy, and Contract of Carriage.</li>
            <li>All nonrefundable funds applied toward the purchase of a new reservation remain nonrefundable.</li>
            <li>Expiration dates of applied funds may result in new ticket(s) expiring earlier
                than the 12 months from date of purchase. The new expiration date will be printed
                on the confirmation receipt sent to you.</li>
            <li><strong>Be there with time to spare.</strong> Be sure to arrive at the departure gate
                with your boarding pass at least 10 minutes before your scheduled departure time. Otherwise,
                your reserved space may be canceled and you won't be eligible for denied boarding compensation.</li>
            <li><strong>No Show Policy:</strong> If you are not planning to travel on any portion of this
                itinerary, please cancel your reservation at least 10 minutes prior to the scheduled
                departure of your flight. Customers who fail to cancel reservations for a Economy
                fare segment at least 10 minutes prior to travel and who do not board the flight will be
                considered a no show, and all remaining unused Economy funds will be forfeited.
                All remaining unused Business and Economy Plus funds will be converted to reusable travel
                funds for the originally ticketed Passenger only. If you no show your reward travel reservation,
                the points will be redeposited to the purchaser’s account. Any taxes and
                fees associated with your reward travel reservation will be held for future use in the form of
                reusable travel funds under the name of the traveler(s).</li>
            <li><strong>Prohibition of Multiple/Conflicting Reservations:</strong> To promote seat availability
                for our Customers, Panda Airways® prohibits multiple reservations for the same Passenger departing
                from the same city on the same date, or any multiple reservations containing conflicting or
                overlapping itineraries (such as departures for the same Customer from multiple cities at the
                same time). Furthermore, without advance notice to the Passenger or purchaser, Panda Airways® may
                cancel such reservations, or any other reservations that it believes, in its sole discretion,
                were made without intent to travel. With the exception of Panda Airways® gift cards, funds from
                proactively canceled reservations by Panda Airways® will be returned to the original form of payment.
                Reservations paid for with a Panda Airways® gift card will have the amount applied from the gift
                card held as travel funds for use by the Customer on a future Panda Airways® flight.</li>
